          Frequently Asked Questions
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is for Frequently asked questions about the game. If you have a question related to help or support, please check out the <a href="/Subsites/Excuse.html">Help page</a>.

            <strong>
              Yet another game in alpha?
            </strong>
            <div>
              Yes. However Factorio has a LOT of content already and is reportedly very stable and optimized. Many people have spent tens / hundreds of hours in it already.

          <li>
            <strong>
              When will the game be finished?
            </strong>
            <div>
              We plan to release version 1.0 on September 25th 2020.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Does the 1.0 release mean end of the development?
            </strong>
            <div>
              That is hard to say now. One option is to continue in 'Minecraft style', to regularly release free updates to the game. Another option is that we would work on DLC or an expansion for instance.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              How do I buy this game then?
            </strong>
            <div>
              You can get it from our <a href="/Subsites/Excuse.html">Purchase page</a>, <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/">Steam Early Access</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/factorio">GOG.com</a> or <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/p/factorio_storefront">Humble Store</a>.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              If I buy the game on your Purchase page will I be able to get a Steam key?
            </strong>
            <div>
              Yes, that is possible. After you have bought the game you can connect it to your Steam account at your <a href="/Subsites/Excuse.html">profile page</a> and then have your Steam key emailed to you. Linking to the Steam account is an anti-fraud mechanism. However, this free Steam key only applies to purchases made directly on our webpage: any purchases from 3rd party retailers are not eligible for a Steam key.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              I bought the game via Steam, can I get the Factorio login for that as well?
            </strong>
            <div>
              Yes, it is possible. In game you will have the option to register an account on our webpage. You can also create a free account at factorio.com and then head to your <a href="/profile">profile page</a> where you will find directions on how to link it to your Steam account. It is strongly recommended to create the account with the same username you have on Steam already.

              I came across problems while buying the game, what to do?

            <strong>
              Why should I bother with alpha / early access game and not just wait for the 1.0 release?
            </strong>
            <div>
              You get to see how the game evolves and improves over time, and your feedback may impact the course of development.

            </strong>
            <div>
              No. The price we ask is what we consider a fair price for the game.
